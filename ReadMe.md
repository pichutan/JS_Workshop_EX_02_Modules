# Exercise 2: Working with modules

## Story

The following exercise should help you to try out modules and some other advanced ES6 techniques. We have a simple website, which shows cards of sorting algorithm. 
The cards contain a title, small description, time and space complexity and the execution time for sorting of X elements. 
Also try to improve the code by using already known javascript techniques and functions.

## Task
- Write a function which generates a card template, fill it with data and return the complete HTML markup, so it will be rendered then to the body.
- Write a function which measures the performance of each sorting algorithm when you click on a button

## Additional information
- `card_generator.js`, `data.js` and `sorting_algorithm.js` should be used as modules
- the sorting algorithm and the data will be provided in the javascript files

## Techniques you may use
- modules
- ES6 features like
    - destructuring objects
    - spread parameter
    - and more.
## Bonus Task
- try to avoid `jquery` and use `vanilla javascript` instead
